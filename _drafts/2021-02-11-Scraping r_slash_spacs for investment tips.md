The acronym SPACs has entered my brain from a few different sources recently. Supposedly they are this great investment opportunity. There is a community on Reddit talking about them and it feels like it could be the next wallstreetbets.

I think that if I could scrape data from r/spacs community that could help identify trends early that someone could use to make bets on spacs.

Another thought I had was maybe SPACS are propaganda and just another device to seperate me from my money.
