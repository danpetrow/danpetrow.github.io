<h1>How Many Plants Can I Grown on 1/8th of an Acre</h1>

I enjoy growing plants. It is one of my top hobbies. This year is my third growing season in my current location and I am planning to seriously dial up my production. 



This post outlines the systems I have in place that will allow me to produce thousands of plants this season.

<h2>Starting Seeds Indoors</h2>

Starting seed indoors is crucial for me in hardiness zone 6a. My season isn't all that long so I want to give my seeds all the extra time I can.

<h3>Equipment and Materials</h3>
Lights and Racks.

Buckets.

Make soil.
My Recipe;
Two parts Coco Coir
One Part Perlite or Vermiculite

Combine and mix. Place in five gallon buckets. Heat water to a boil, add to buckets, seal with a lid. Viola, sterilized seed starting mix. 

Add soil to seed flats.

Start Peppers, Tomatoes, cool season crops, some flowers.

Start herbs and flowers.
Pot up peppers, tomatoes, ect.
