<h1>Garden Log 2021 | How Many Plants Can I Grown on 1/8th of an Acre</h1>

I enjoy growing plants. It is one of my top hobbies. This year is my third growing season in my current location and I am planning to seriously dial up my production. 

This post is meant to be informative about the systems I plan to use and have used to optimize how much I can grow with limited land. I hope that writing information will make 2022 a better growing year for whoever reads this.

When I first started writing this post I estimated that I would grow 4500 plants. 
<h2>Starting Seeds Indoors</h2>

Starting seed indoors is crucial for me in hardiness zone 6a. My season isn't all that long so I want to give my seeds all the extra time I can.

<h3>Equipment and Materials</h3>
Lights and Racks.
<img src="/../seed_starting_setup.jpg" alt="Seed Starting Shelves" />
Buckets.
Coco Coir.
Perlite or Vermiculite.
Compost.
Seeds.
Seed Trays and Cells.

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<h4>February</h4>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Make seed starting mix.
Start Peppers, Tomatoes, cool season crops, some flowers.
Water the seeds in initially then bottom water until first true leaves appear. Make sure 

<h5>Execution</h5>
2021-02-12
Made 30 gallons of seed starting mix.
My Recipe;
Two parts Coco Coir
One Part Perlite or Vermiculite
One Part Compost
Combine and mix. Place in five gallon buckets. Heat water to a boil, add to buckets, seal with a lid. Viola, sterilized seed starting mix.

Add soil to seed flats. I added soil to nine seed flats which took me about an hour to do being careful not to spill all over the basement.
In my nine seed trays there are about 150 400 256 144 cells. That was three trays of 50. Two trays of 200, 128, and 72.
I started lettuce, peppers, tomatoes, chard, ground cherries, strawberries, african daisies, asparagus, spinach.
I also started to stratify lavendar today.
As of today I have started 950 seeds plus a few hundred lavendar seeds so lets just call the total seeds started at this point 1000.
2021-02-25
We started pear seeds in papers towels and sandwich bags. These seeds were put on the heating register and kept dark to germinate. 
We also started stratifying gala apple seeds.
2021-02-27
Today I noticed my lettuce, chard, and spinach had germinated. 

Today I planted another thousand seeds bringing my total up to around 2000 plants. 
We also did a tray of microgreens.
I used up my 30 gallons of seed starting mix.
Broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, onions, kale, cabbage, brussel sprouts, eggplants, tomatillos.
2021-02-28
I noticed an african daisy had germinated today.

Also I started in an attempt to propogate two magnolia plants. I cut them at the beginning of the green new growth on the stem, dipped them in rooting powder, removed all leaves except the top most leaves and put them into my potting mix in a self wicking pot. 

<h4>March</h4>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Start herbs and flowers.
Pot up peppers, tomatoes, ect.
<h5>Execution</h5>

2021-03-11
I have an issue with algeal growth and will need to test a method to fix that. I've read about using hydrogen peroxide to kill the algae which is what I will test. Since my last post onions, tomatoes, cabbage, brussel sprouts have germinated but I still haven't had any strawberries, asparagus, ground cherries, eggplant, tomatillos or peppers germinate.

To improve my seed starting area I think that I would want to increase temperature, and improve air movement in the area.

2021-03-15
I have a problem with algae growing on my starts so I will be trialing a treating them with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. 
Today I noticed some hot peppers had germinated. 
<h4>April</h4>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Start Sunflowers, pumpkin, winter squash, watermelon, cucumber.
Transfer hardy starts outside.
<h5>Execution</h5>
<h4>May</h4>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Start direct sowed plants.
Transfer tender starts outside
<h5>Execution</h5>

<h2>Transferring Seeds Outside</h2>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Growbags and raised beds will be the primary medium of growth. There is a possibility that I will also grow in the Manchester Community Garden.
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<h5>Plan</h5>
I would like to improve on the irrigation that was done last year. I appreciated the bronze colored drip line that I used although I'm not sure that it was enough or had enough pressure to water all of 250 feet or whatever it was rigged to do along with the drippers. I might want to add zones with automatic valves this year. The drippers that went into the large tomatoe bags worked well but using them under the black plastic didn't work. I think the overhead sprayers/misters will be something to try this year. The black plastic that I used last year also was something I didn't like, need to be sure that the plastic is breathable so water can penetrate easily.
<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<h5>Plan</h5>
I would like to have my primary source of nutrients come from the garden from April to October. This is vague but the goal would be to record some measurement of how much food I did yield.
I would like to try my hand at seed saving this year.
<h2>End of Season</h2>
<h5>Plan</h5>
Collect my thoughts. Reevaluate how processes could be improved. Figure out how to implement improvments. Determine if farming is a good side hustle, cost cutter, hobby worth further investing in. Figure out how to go bigger next year generally.
