I think that one of my limiting factors is time. I believe I would accomplish plenty if I had 9-6 to work on my pet projects. I also don't think that I am a good judge all the time. I think this could be one of my blindspots. What does my closest and most trusted source think would happen if I didn't work 9-6?
