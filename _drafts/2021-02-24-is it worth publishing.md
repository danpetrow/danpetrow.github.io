I've written many things that looking back were low quality or didn't stand up over time. Therefore I believe it is important to formalize the criteria for which I decide a post is worthy of being posted.

A blog post should either document a place and subject in time and be valuable when revisiting in the future, be beneficial for someone else who is trying to learn about a subject, or it should make a measurable claim about a subject that is testable or verifiable in the future.

For example, I feel good about what I'm currently writing regarding my gardening systems and strategies. This is a documentation of my past and present gardening strategies that will be valuable to look back on in the future. This post also asserts that i will start 4500 plants this season which is a verifiable claim about the future.

Two other posts that i appreciate are the quarterly review post and the technologies to learn in 2021 post.

The first post to me feels like a guide written after a first hand experience and all of them feel a bit like an experiement. They all contain a bit of a claim that i will do something before a specific date in the future.

I dont want to be a flowery writer because i would like really clear criteria for what is worth the time to write about.

Is the post an experiment? If so what are the assertions, the methodologies to test the assertion and the results?
Is the post a how to/guide/review written after a first hand experience?

Things a post probably shouldnt be.
A reaction to someone elses ideas at least without first hand experience
A journal entry. This is valuable but probably better private.
