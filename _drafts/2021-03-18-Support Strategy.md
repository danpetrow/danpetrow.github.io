Track your time. Consider using Toggl.

Document and simplify anything you do more than twice. The second time you visit a topic record a video if you haven't already.

Make time for strategy. Spend 30 minutes first thing to prioritize work.

Video is a tool. Do once, teach forever. Record everything with OBS.

Use hotkeys when possible. AutoHotkeys saves time.

Each ticket/thread should have only one main topic. Don't create confusion and make yourself look better. Open another ticket for that second issue.

Create a personal knowledgebase. Try out Notion.
