I know that there can be value in a successful prediction. Understanding that there is potentially value to a correct predict might explain why I abosultely love when a prediction of mine comes true. It hardly even matters if there is real value to the prediction being made, the reward of being right is great enough sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a special predictive ability. I have biases as do all people. I believe a good method to combat ones own biases could be to look at other peoples predictions and hopefully get some insight into the underlying assumptions behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a website where people make predictions and record just how sure they are that it will happen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://predictionbook.com/predictions&quot;&gt;Other People’s Predictions&lt;/a&gt;. I think there is a lot of insight to be gleaned from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing&quot;&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt; predictions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Electronic_Markets&quot;&gt;Iowa Electronic Markets&lt;/a&gt; is an example of the predictive power of crowds. Predictionbook is especially interesting because there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tricycle/predictionbook/blob/master/API.md&quot;&gt;api&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be an interesting project to try to extract something of value from these predictions. I can imagine a bot that is able to identify predictions in other forums (reddit) which would be of great value as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dan</name></author><summary type="html">I very much like predictions.
