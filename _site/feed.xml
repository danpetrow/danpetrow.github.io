Here is what I learned for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby -v
You can uninstall the whole Ruby language but files are left behind really.
bundle update
You can delete your gemfile and gemfile.lock if you accidentally run this and get in a bad state.
gem uninstall -a
This will uninstall all of the gems currently installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are free from your previous errors and are running fresh you can jump to here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bundle init 
Creates a new gemfile in the working directory.
bundle add jekyll
Creates your gemfile.lock with most of your dependencies(the gems you need to install)
bundle install
install the gems you need
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem ‘jekyll-sitemap’
  gem ‘jekyll-feed’
  gem ‘jekyll-seo-tag’
end
Add you plugins to gemfile
gem “webrick”
Add webrick to your gemfile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be good to go after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t mess with bundle update if things are working maybe?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dan</name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday I sent about four hours trying to figure out why Jekyll wouldn’t run.

I made quite a few mistakes already with git that caused my remote branches and my local branches to be in a bad state. Luckily, I created remote and local staging branches and managed to keep in tact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned tonight is the importance of deleting local branches when you are done with them because they cause problems if you leave them and don’t know exactly what you are doing. Here are some commands to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git checkout -b &quot;branch&quot; - This creates a new local branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git push origin &quot;branch&quot; - This creates a new remote branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git pull origin &quot;branch&quot; - This will take remote &quot;branch&quot; and make your local working branch look like remote &quot;branch&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git push origin --delete &quot;branch&quot; - This will delete a remote branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git branch -D &quot;branch&quot; - This will delete a local branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git branch - This lists our local branches and highlights our current branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git branch -a - This lists all of our branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git branch status - This lists what branch we are on as well as any changes to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep a staging branch both locally and remotely that you only touch when you are sure that your commits won’t break anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dan</name></author><summary type="html">Today I used Git again.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a truck bed camper shell out of reclaimed materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an Ecommerce webapp with Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow 4500 seedlings.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write six good blog posts.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out more features on this site&lt;li&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If I am to accomplish all of this I will need to be consistent and be happy with small progress. 

EDIT:2021-02-03: I&apos;m reflecting on my goals and what I have done in the weeks since I wrote this. I am afraid that the truck bed camper is going to be pushed back to quarter two. I&apos;m not all that sad about this but I think it will be the reality of the situation. I am making good progress on the seedlings and I have my systems ready to get started growing. Ecommerce webapp with Python has turned into webapp with Javascript which I am making progress with. Blog posts, I have a few drafts so hopefully they flesh out into something good. Features, I added the priority matrix which I think should be useful for outlining my hopes and dreams. I don&apos;t have any other feature ideas right now but maybe I will think of some later. I think I want to move away from python and move back into javascript for now; just a thought.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>dan</name></author><summary type="html">A simple list of some of what I hope to accomplish in quarter one of 2021.

I know that there can be value in a successful prediction. Understanding that there is potentially value to a correct predict might explain why I abosultely love when a prediction of mine comes true. It hardly even matters if there is real value to the prediction being made, the reward of being right is great enough sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a special predictive ability. I have biases as do all people. I believe a good method to combat ones own biases could be to look at other peoples predictions and hopefully get some insight into the underlying assumptions behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a website where people make predictions and record just how sure they are that it will happen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://predictionbook.com/predictions&quot;&gt;Other People’s Predictions&lt;/a&gt;. I think there is a lot of insight to be gleaned from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing&quot;&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt; predictions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Electronic_Markets&quot;&gt;Iowa Electronic Markets&lt;/a&gt; is an example of the predictive power of crowds. Predictionbook is especially interesting because there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tricycle/predictionbook/blob/master/API.md&quot;&gt;api&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be an interesting project to try to extract something of value from these predictions. I can imagine a bot that is able to identify predictions in other forums (reddit) which would be of great value as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dan</name></author><summary type="html">I very much like predictions.
