A simple list of some of what I hope to accomplish in quarter one of 2021.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Build a truck bed camper shell out of reclaimed materials.</li>
<li>Build an Ecommerce webapp with Python.</li>
<li>Grow 4500 seedlings.<li>
<li>Write six good blog posts.<li>
<li>Build out more features on this site<li>
<br><br>
If I am to accomplish all of this I will need to be consistent and be happy with small progress.
