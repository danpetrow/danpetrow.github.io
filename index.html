		<h1>Who is Dan Petrow </h1>
		<p>
		Hi, this is Dan. I like nature and I work with software. If you like software check out the blog where I write about being a <a href="https://danpetrow.com/blog">sometimes software developer</a>. 
			<br><br>
		I like coding in python, I do a bit of front-end html and css, and maybe I will learn C one of these days.
			<br><br>
		I like gardening, hiking with my wife and dogs and woodworking if I'm feeling really motivated.
			<br><br>
		Send me a message if you want to. <a href="mailto:dppetrow@gmail.com">Dan</a>.
