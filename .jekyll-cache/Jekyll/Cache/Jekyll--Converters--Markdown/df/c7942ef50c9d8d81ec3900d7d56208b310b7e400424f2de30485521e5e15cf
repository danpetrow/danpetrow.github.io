I"A<p>Here in the beginning of 2021 I would like to set some goals regarding the technologies that I would like to learn about this year. At the end of the year I can reflect on what I learned from this list, how I have used it, how I can continue using these things, and what I liked and didnâ€™t like about each item.</p>
