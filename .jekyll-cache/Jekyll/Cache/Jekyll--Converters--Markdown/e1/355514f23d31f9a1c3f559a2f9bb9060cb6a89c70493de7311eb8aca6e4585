I"<p>A simple list of some of what I hope to accomplish in quarter one of 2021.
<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Build a truck bed camper shell out of reclaimed materials.</li>
<li>Build an Ecommerce webapp with Python.</li>
<li>Grow 4500 seedlings.<li>
<li>Write six good blog posts.<li>
<li>Build out more features on this site<li>
<br /><br />
If I am to accomplish all of this I will need to be consistent and be happy with small progress. 

EDIT:2021-02-03: I'm reflecting on my goals and what I have done in the weeks since I wrote this. I am afraid that the truck bed camper is going to be pushed back to quarter two. I'm not all that sad about this but I think it will be the reality of the situation. I am making good progress on the seedlings and I have my systems ready to get started growing. Ecommerce webapp with Python has turned into webapp with Javascript which I am making progress with. Blog posts, I have a few drafts so hopefully they flesh out into something good. Features, I added the priority matrix which I think should be useful for outlining my hopes and dreams. I don't have any other feature ideas right now but maybe I will think of some later. I think I want to move away from python and move back into javascript for now; just a thought.
