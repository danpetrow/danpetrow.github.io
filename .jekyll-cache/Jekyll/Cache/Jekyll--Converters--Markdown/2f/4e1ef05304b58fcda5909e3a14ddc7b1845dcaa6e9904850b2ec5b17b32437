I"¼<p>I very much like predictions. I know that there can be value in a successful prediction. Understanding that there is potentially value to a correct predict might explain why I abosultely love when a prediction of mine comes true. It hardly even matters if there is real value to the prediction being made, the reward of being right is great enough sometimes.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have a special predictive ability. I have biases as do all people. I believe a good method to combat ones own biases could be to look at other peoples predictions and hopefully get some insight into the underlying assumptions behind them.</p>

<p>I found a website where people make predictions and record just how sure they are that it will happen. <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions">Other Peopleâ€™s Predictions</a>. I think there is a lot of insight to be gleaned from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourced</a> predictions. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Electronic_Markets">Iowa Electronic Markets</a> is an example of the predictive power of crowds. Predictionbook is especially interesting because there is an <a href="https://github.com/tricycle/predictionbook/blob/master/API.md">api</a>.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting project to try to extract something of value from these predictions. I can imagine a bot that is able to identify predictions in other forums (reddit) which would be of great value as well.</p>
